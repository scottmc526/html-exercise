    <p>
    I grew up in Evergreen, CO. I then went to college in Boulder, and I now live in Denver for Gschool.

    <h1>List of cities I want to visit</h1>
    <p>
    I've always been fascinated with the U.K. and its similarities and differences with the U.S. Some of my friends have visited Tokyo and they have had nothing but amazing things to say about it. Finally, one of my really good friends just moved to Seattle and I would like to go visit.
